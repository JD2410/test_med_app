# Stayhealthy - Medical Appointment Booking System

StayHealthy Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare facilities in remote areas with minimal to no medical facilities or resources. The Executive Director has started the Go digital initiative as part of StayHealthy's broader vision to maximize reach. One aspect of the initiative is building a website to help patients access doctors anytime, anywhere.

## Problem Statement

StayHealthy conducted an extensive survey to assess the medical facilities available in remote areas and found that several patients have a tough time finding the right doctor at the right time. There are usually no doctors or hospitals within a 50-mile radius, or the wait time to meet a doctor is too long. Many times, this has resulted in life-threatening emergencies or lost lives.
With the internet and broadband availability increasing in remote areas, the initiative from StayHealthy will help get patients access to general physicians and specialists at the right time easily.

## Features

- **Medical appointments online
The website should enable patients to schedule appointments with doctors from anywhere at any time. It must also support on-demand consultations without requiring prior appointments. Patients should be able to view available time slots for each doctor and choose their preferred time. Additionally, the system should send reminders or notifications for upcoming appointments and allow patients to easily cancel or modify their bookings as needed.

- **Doctor listing for patients
The website should allow patients to view a list of available doctors along with their ratings. Users must be able to see detailed reviews and comments from other patients to help inform their decisions. Additionally, the system should include a search function that enables patients to easily find a specific doctor by name.

- **Consultation Feedback
The patient/end-user must be able to rate the consultation on effectiveness in terms of diagnosis, communication, and so on to contribute to the system's transparency and help other patients make informed choices.

- **Profile Management
To book an appointment, users must first sign up on the website. During the booking process, they are required to provide essential information such as their name, address, phone number, age, blood group, and any existing medical records. Users should also have the ability to update their personal details at any time.

- **Access to patient records
Patient records must remain private, accessible only to the respective doctor and patient. Patients should also be able to download their medical records, such as test reports, for their personal use. To promote awareness and encourage healthy living, the website should feature a news feed with daily health tips and educational videos categorized by topic. Additionally, the site should offer a smooth user experience with intuitive navigation, allowing users to access key features and information with minimal clicks.

- **Website Administration
The system should allow users to manage both patient and doctor profiles while ensuring security and data integrity. It must also support the generation of reports and analytics, providing insights into appointment bookings, patient demographics, and healthcare provider performance to help improve overall service quality.
